# Open Rocketry Project

### Background

I'm a model rocketeer with a 3d printer. I started out building nosecones and jigs with OpenSCAD. As the nosecones got more complicated, I needed the ability to parameterize thngs even further. Such as the addition of bases, wall thickness and so forth.

I implemented the classic nosecones found on Wikipedia and added a few more I found posted by reverse engineering what I saw on thingverse. Pretty soon, I had a pretty rich set of building blocks

### Mission

My mission here is to  provide the tools I've developed for myself. In addition, I hope to encourge this to evolve into a wider community. 

### Overview

Presently this is an embryonic state as far as project maturity. While the nosecone is pretty evolved technically, it lacks documentation and testing. Very few safeguards are in to insure parameters don't result in a degenerate nosecone. Furthermore, there is little documentation.
Once I fill in my core set of functionality. I will start to fill in documentation.

Consider this an early alpha state.

I welcome issues and pull requests.
